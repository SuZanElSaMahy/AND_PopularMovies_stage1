# PopularMovies Stage1

Most of us can relate to kicking back on the couch and enjoying a movie with friends and family. 
In this project, It's required to build an app to allow users to discover the most popular movies playing. 
The development of this app is split in two stages. 

The app will:

- Present the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters upon launch.
- Allow your user to change sort order via a setting:
  - The sort order can be by most popular or by highest-rated
- Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as:
  - original title
  - movie poster image thumbnail
  - A plot synopsis (called overview in the api)
  - user rating (called vote_average in the api)
  - release date


This stage is to learn to : 
- Fetch data from the Internet with theMovieDB API.
- Use adapters and custom list layouts to populate list views.
- Incorporate libraries to simplify the amount of code needed to be written.
